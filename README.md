# Picture-Conversion-Tool


A Python GUI Script/exe File that converts JPEG, PNG, ICO, and other files to your desire conversion. 
This tool is free and can be used for whatever reason.  
Modifications will happen to images, but the original Image will remain the same. In short we are only creating
